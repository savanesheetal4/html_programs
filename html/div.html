            The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
 <span style="color: rgb(38, 0, 255);">Hello</span>
                The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
                
                By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                
                An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                A visited link is underlined and purple
                An active link is underlined and red
